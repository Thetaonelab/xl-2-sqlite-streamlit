# Product Context: Excel to SQLite Production Dashboard

## Problem Statement
Oil and gas production facilities generate large volumes of data in Excel spreadsheets, making it challenging to:
1. Efficiently analyze production trends across multiple delivery networks
2. Compare different production metrics (oil, gas, condensate, water)
3. Visualize historical data alongside current production
4. Share insights with stakeholders in an accessible format
5. Maintain data consistency across different analysis workflows

## Solution
This project transforms Excel-based production data into a structured SQLite database and provides an interactive Streamlit dashboard for visualization and analysis. This approach solves several key challenges:

### Data Management Improvements
- **Centralized Storage**: Converts disparate Excel files into a unified SQLite database
- **Data Integrity**: Ensures consistent data structure and relationships
- **Query Efficiency**: Enables complex queries that would be difficult in Excel
- **Version Control**: Maintains historical data alongside current production figures
- **Automation**: Streamlines the process of incorporating new data

### User Experience Goals
- **Intuitive Interface**: Non-technical users can explore production data without SQL knowledge
- **Interactive Filtering**: Users can dynamically select metrics, networks, and time periods
- **Visual Insights**: Clear visualizations highlight production patterns and anomalies
- **Comparative Analysis**: Easy comparison between different delivery networks
- **Responsive Design**: Works across different devices and screen sizes

### Stakeholder Benefits
- **Operations Teams**: Monitor production volumes across networks in real-time
- **Management**: Access high-level summaries and detailed breakdowns as needed
- **Analysts**: Perform trend analysis and identify optimization opportunities
- **IT Department**: Reduced maintenance compared to Excel-based reporting
- **Field Teams**: Validate production data against expectations

## Target Users
1. **Production Engineers**: Monitor daily/weekly production metrics
2. **Operations Managers**: Track performance across multiple delivery networks
3. **Data Analysts**: Identify trends and optimization opportunities
4. **Executive Leadership**: Review high-level production summaries
5. **Field Supervisors**: Verify reported production against actual operations

## Key Workflows
1. **Data Import**: Convert new Excel files to SQLite database entries
2. **Network Analysis**: Compare production across different delivery networks
3. **Time Series Exploration**: Analyze production trends over time
4. **Metric Comparison**: Evaluate different production metrics (oil, gas, etc.)
5. **Data Export**: Extract filtered data for external reporting

## Success Metrics
- Reduction in time spent analyzing production data
- Increased accuracy in production reporting
- Improved accessibility of insights to stakeholders
- Faster identification of production anomalies
- Streamlined incorporation of new production data
